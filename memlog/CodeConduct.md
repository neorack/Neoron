# Neoron Project Guidelines

This document outlines the coding standards, architectural principles, and workflow for the Neoron project. Adherence to these guidelines ensures code quality, maintainability, and consistency across the project.

## Code Style

- **C# Coding Conventions:** Adhere to the latest Microsoft C# coding conventions.  Use the [official Microsoft style guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/coding-style/index) as a reference.
- **Meaningful Names:** Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, methods, classes, and namespaces.  Avoid abbreviations unless widely understood within the project.
- **Method Size:** Keep methods focused and concise.  Large methods should be broken down into smaller, more manageable units.
- **Documentation:** Document public APIs with comprehensive XML comments.  Comments should clearly explain the purpose, parameters, return values, and potential exceptions of each method.
- **Asynchronous Operations:** Use `async` and `await` consistently for asynchronous operations.  Avoid blocking the main thread.
- **Readability:** Prioritize code readability. Use consistent indentation, spacing, and formatting to enhance clarity.

## Architecture

- **Clean Architecture:** Follow the principles of Clean Architecture.  Separate concerns into distinct layers (e.g., Presentation, Application, Domain, Infrastructure).
- **Thin Controllers:** Keep controllers thin and focused on handling requests and responses.  Complex logic should be delegated to services.
- **Dependency Injection:** Utilize dependency injection extensively.  This promotes testability, maintainability, and reduces coupling between components.
- **SOLID Principles:** Adhere to the SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion).
- **Repository Pattern:** Employ the repository pattern for data access.  This decouples the application logic from the specific data storage mechanism.

## Testing

- **Unit Tests:** Write comprehensive unit tests for all business logic and services. Isolate units of code and test their behavior in isolation. ✓
- **Integration Tests:** Write integration tests to verify the interaction between different components (e.g., repositories and controllers). Use tools like Testcontainers to simulate external dependencies. ✓
- **Test Naming:** Use descriptive and meaningful names for tests. Test names should clearly indicate the scenario being tested. ✓
- **Arrange-Act-Assert:** Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern for writing tests. This pattern improves test readability and maintainability. ✓
- **Mocking:** Mock external dependencies (e.g., databases, external APIs) in unit tests to isolate the code under test. ✓
- **Edge Cases:** Include tests for edge cases, error conditions, and boundary scenarios. ✓
- **Performance Tests:** Include tests for performance-critical paths and concurrent operations. ✓

## Git Workflow

- **Feature Branches:** Use feature branches for development.  This allows for parallel development and easier merging of changes.
- **Meaningful Commit Messages:** Write concise and informative commit messages.  Each commit should describe the changes made and the reason for the changes.
- **Atomic Commits:** Keep commits focused and atomic.  Each commit should represent a single, logical change.
- **Pull Requests:** Use pull requests for code review before merging changes into the main branch.
- **Squashing:** Squash commits before merging to maintain a clean commit history.

## API Design

- **REST Principles:** Adhere to RESTful principles for API design.  Use appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes.
- **Versioning:** Version APIs appropriately to manage compatibility between different versions.
- **Input Validation:** Validate all inputs to prevent unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities.
- **Error Handling:** Implement consistent error handling to provide informative error responses to clients.

## Security

- **Input Validation:** Validate all inputs to prevent injection attacks and other security vulnerabilities.
- **HTTPS:** Use HTTPS for all API communication to ensure secure data transmission.
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.
- **Authentication:** Implement robust authentication mechanisms (e.g., JWT).
- **Authorization:** Implement authorization mechanisms to control access to resources based on user roles and permissions.
- **OWASP:** Follow OWASP security guidelines to mitigate potential security risks.

## Performance

- **Asynchronous Operations:** Use `async` and `await` for I/O-bound operations to improve responsiveness.
- **Caching:** Implement caching where appropriate to reduce database load and improve performance.
- **Database Optimization:** Optimize database queries and indexes to improve query performance.
- **Pagination:** Use pagination for large datasets to improve performance and prevent excessive data transfer.
- **Profiling:** Profile and benchmark critical paths to identify performance bottlenecks.

## Documentation

- **README:** Keep the README file up-to-date with project information, setup instructions, and usage examples.
- **API Documentation:** Generate comprehensive API documentation to help developers understand the available endpoints and their usage.
- **Setup Guide:** Provide clear and concise instructions for setting up the development environment.
- **Deployment Guide:** Provide clear and concise instructions for deploying the application to production.
- **Security Documentation:** Document security considerations and best practices.

## Code Review Process

- **Pull Request Reviews:** Conduct thorough code reviews on all pull requests.
- **Review Criteria:** Review code for adherence to coding standards, security best practices, and performance considerations.
- **Feedback:** Provide constructive feedback to improve code quality and maintainability.

## Project Status Tracking

- Use `status-tracking.md` to track the project's progress and identify tasks that need attention.

## Task Management

- Use `tasks.md` to manage and track tasks related to the project.

## Other Important Considerations

- **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to provide informative error responses to clients.
- **Logging:** Implement appropriate logging to track application behavior and diagnose issues.
- **Monitoring:** Implement monitoring to track application performance and identify potential issues.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Implement CI/CD pipelines to automate the build, test, and deployment process.
