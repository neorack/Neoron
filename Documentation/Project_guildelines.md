## **3. Incorporating Functional Programming Paradigms**

Integrate functional programming concepts in a way that adheres to Clean Code principles.

### **Functional Programming Principles to Apply**

- **Immutability**:
  - Favor immutable data structures.
  - Use `readonly` fields and `record` types.

- **Pure Functions**:
  - Write functions that have no side effects and return the same output for the same input.

- **Higher-Order Functions**:
  - Pass functions as parameters and return them as results.

- **Expression Transparency**:
  - Ensure that the behavior of code is predictable and transparent.

### **Applying Functional Programming in the Project**

#### **Domain Layer**

- **Immutable Entities and Value Objects**:
  - Example:
    ```csharp
    public record Product
    {
        public Guid Id { get; init; }
        public string Name { get; init; }
        public decimal Price { get; init; }

        public Product ChangePrice(decimal newPrice) => this with { Price = newPrice };
    }
    ```
  - **Clean Code Alignment**: Promotes simplicity and reduces side effects.

- **Pure Functions for Business Logic**:
  - Encapsulate logic in functions without side effects.

- **Avoid Static Classes**:
  - Keep functions in contextually appropriate classes or modules.

#### **Application Layer**

- **Service Composition**:
  - Build services by composing pure functions.
  - Example:
    ```csharp
    public class InventoryService : IInventoryService
    {
        private readonly IProductRepository _productRepository;

        public InventoryService(IProductRepository productRepository)
        {
            _productRepository = productRepository;
        }

        public async Task<Result<Product>> UpdateProductPrice(Guid productId, decimal newPrice)
        {
            var productResult = await _productRepository.GetByIdAsync(productId);
            return productResult
                .ToResult("Product not found.")
                .Bind(product => Result.Success(product.ChangePrice(newPrice)))
                .Tap(async updatedProduct => await _productRepository.UpdateAsync(updatedProduct));
        }
    }
    ```
  - **Clean Code Alignment**: Functions are small, do one thing well, and are easy to test.

#### **Infrastructure Layer**

- **Functional Data Access**:
  - Use LINQ expressions and deferred execution where appropriate.
  - Keep repository methods concise and expressive.

- **Isolation of Side Effects**:
  - Limit database interactions to this layer.
  - Keep other layers pure.

#### **API Layer**

- **Functional Endpoints**:
  - Controllers handle HTTP requests and responses, delegating logic to services.

- **Asynchronous Programming**:
  - Use `async` and `await` patterns effectively.

#### **Testing**

- **Leverage Immutability and Pure Functions**:
  - Simplify tests due to predictable function outputs.
  - Reduce the need for extensive mocking.

- **Property-Based Testing**:
  - Use frameworks like FsCheck to test properties over a range of inputs.

#### **Overall Architectural Considerations**

- **Functional Core, Imperative Shell**:
  - Keep the core logic pure and functional.
  - Encapsulate side effects in the outer layers.

- **Avoid Nullable Types Where Possible**:
  - Use `Option<T>` or similar constructs to represent optional values.

- **Error Handling**:
  - Use functional patterns for error propagation (e.g., `Result<T>`, `Either<TLeft, TRight>`).

### **Clean Code Principles Reinforced by Functional Programming**

- **Single Responsibility Principle**:
  - Functions and methods do one thing.

- **Expressiveness**:
  - Code reads like well-written prose.

- **Avoidance of Side Effects**:
  - Functions are predictable and easier to test.

- **Clear Error Handling**:
  - Errors are handled explicitly and transparently.
