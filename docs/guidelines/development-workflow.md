# Development Workflow

## Version Control
- Use feature branches (feature/, bugfix/, hotfix/)
- Follow conventional commits
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Squash before merging
- Use pull requests
- Document breaking changes

## Testing Protocol
- Write unit tests for business logic
- Create integration tests for APIs
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow Arrange-Act-Assert
- Mock external dependencies
- Maintain 80% code coverage
- Test error scenarios

## Review Requirements
- Mandatory code reviews
- Pull request process
- Security assessment
- Test coverage verification
- Documentation updates
- Performance review

## Deployment Process
- Use continuous integration
- Run automated tests
- Follow semantic versioning
- Maintain deployment docs
- Keep scripts updated
- Document rollback procedures

## Monitoring Requirements
- Implement structured logging
- Configure alerting
- Monitor system health
- Track key metrics
- Use appropriate log levels
- Set up dashboards
