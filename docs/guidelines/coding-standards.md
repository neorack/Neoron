# Development Standards

## Core Principles
- Reliability First: Every change must improve system stability
- Defensive Programming: Validate inputs, handle errors gracefully
- Maintainable Code: Clear structure, well-documented, easily testable
- Follow SOLID principles and Clean Architecture

## Code Organization
### Size Guidelines
- Methods: ≤20 lines
- Classes: ≤200 lines
- Files: ≤300 lines

### Architecture
- Follow Clean Architecture principles
- Keep controllers thin, business logic in services
- Use dependency injection
- Implement repository pattern
- Group by feature when possible
- Maintain clear separation of concerns

### Style
- Follow Microsoft's C# coding conventions
- Use meaningful and descriptive names
- Document public APIs with XML comments
- Use async/await consistently
- Follow SOLID principles

## Database
- Follow Entity Framework Core best practices
- Implement proper indexing strategies
- Use appropriate data types
- Define clear relationships
- Implement soft delete where appropriate
- Optimize query performance

## Security
- Validate all inputs
- Use HTTPS everywhere
- Implement rate limiting
- Follow OWASP guidelines
- Keep dependencies updated
- Use proper authentication
- Implement authorization
- Secure credential management
- Data encryption
- Authorization checks

## Performance
- Use async operations for I/O
- Implement strategic caching
- Optimize database queries
- Use pagination for large datasets
- Profile critical paths
- Monitor performance metrics
- Resource monitoring
- Scalability planning

## Testing
- 80% minimum code coverage
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for APIs
- Performance benchmarks
- Load testing for critical paths
- Follow Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Mock external dependencies
- Test error scenarios

## Monitoring & Observability
- Health checks
- Performance metrics
- Error tracking
- Usage analytics
- System alerts
- Structured logging
- Configure alerting
- Set up dashboards

## Version Control
- Use conventional commits (feat:, fix:, docs:)
- One logical change per commit
- Branch naming: feature/, bugfix/, hotfix/
- Use pull requests for code review
- Squash commits before merging

## Change Management
- Impact analysis
- Rollback procedures
- Dependency tracking
- Breaking change notices
- Migration guides
- Document deployment procedures
- Maintain deployment scripts
